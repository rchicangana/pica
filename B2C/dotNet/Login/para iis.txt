I also was getting the same problem but after brain storming with IIS and google for many hours. I found out the solution. This error is because some settings are disabled in IIS applicationHost.config.

Below are the steps to solution:

Go to C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config and open in notepad
Change the following key value present in

<section name="handlers" overrideModeDefault="Deny" /> change this value from "Deny" to "Allow"

<section name="modules" allowDefinition="MachineToApplication" overrideModeDefault="Deny" /> change this value from "Deny" to "Allow"

"%WINDIR%\Microsoft.Net\Framework\v3.0\Windows Communication Foundation\ServiceModelReg.exe" -r
